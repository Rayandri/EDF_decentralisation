# Decentralized Electricity Provider using Blockchain Technology

### This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©) project on decentralized electricity provision using blockchain technology. 

The TIPE is a personal research project that students in France undertake as part of their studies, and I completed it during my time in the Maths Physique Informatique (Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science) program.

The project focuses on addressing the security and privacy concerns associated with centralized electricity providers by implementing a decentralized solution. By utilizing blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum and smart contracts, the project aims to create a transparent, secure, and user-controlled electricity provision system.

The repository includes the Solidity code for the smart contracts, as well as the front-end interface for users to interact with the system. The project also explores the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for contract management and payment settlement.

By making the code open-source, the project ensures transparency and allows for peer review, promoting trust between the electricity provider and the consumers. The use of blockchain technology guarantees the integrity and immutability of the transaction history, providing a reliable and auditable system.

This repository serves as a demonstration of how blockchain technology can be applied to decentralize essential services, offering a potential solution to the security and privacy challenges associated with centralized systems.
